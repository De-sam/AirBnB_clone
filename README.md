# AirBnB Clone Command-Line Interpreter

## Project Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This initial step involves creating a command-line interpreter. The primary goal is to manage AirBnB objects through commands, enabling users to perform actions such as creating new objects, retrieving objects, and updating attributes.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to interact with AirBnB objects using a set of commands.

### How to Start

To launch the command-line interpreter, run the `console.py` script:

```bash
$ ./console.py
```

### How to Use

Once the interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

- `help`: Display a list of documented commands.
- `quit`: Exit the command-line interpreter.

### Examples

You can interact with the interpreter both interactively and in non-interactive mode:

Interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
# ... (commands output)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

Non-interactive mode:

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
# ... (commands output)
$
```
